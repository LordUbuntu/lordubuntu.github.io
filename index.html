  <h1>Jacobus Burger</h1>
  <h2>Computer Alchemist</h2>
  <p>Hey there! My name is Jacobus Burger. I'm a computer scientist whose
  interests include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fullstack Web Development</li>
    <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
    <li>Robotics</li>
    <li>And much more!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You may be wondering...</p>
  <h3>What is a Computer Alchemist?</h3>
  <p>In essence, a <bold>Computer Alchemist</bold> transforms problems
  into solutions like ancient alchemists hoped to transmute lead into
  gold. A Computer Alchemist (aka: A Computer Scientist) transforms the
  problems encountered into incredible programs. I do just that and more!</p>
  
  <p>I'm a curious lifelong learner always growing, I'm quick to learn new
  things too. I like to challenge with difficult problems and make cool
  projects that help people.</p>

  <p>I'm excited to hear from you! If you'd like to see more, please check out
  my work at <a href="https://github.com/LordUbuntu">GitHub LordUbuntu</a></p>
